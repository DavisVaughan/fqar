* No notes locally, but check_rhub() flags the spelling of the term "floristic" in the DESCRIPTION file. The current spelling is correct. Additionally, the reference "Freyman at al" is flagged but is written as intended.

* This is a re-submission of a new release. Per reviewer comments:
  - Examples in function documentation are no longer enclosed in \dontrun. Instead, the ones that run very slowly now use \donttest. Test coverage for these functions can be found in the tests directory.
  - These examples are now properly commented
  - doi reference has been added to DESCRIPTION as requested

* Thank you for your work!!
